Add Genre to campaigns: change appearance of encounter log based on genre?
  fantasy/sci-fi/modern

Is there a way to condense the three new character actions into a single action? (Does sinatra have a way to use partials)


Need help with responsive scaling. (example: encounters index page, have "scroll-log" shrink to fit viewport)
